# FAQ

## Getting the Specification

### Where can I find the latest version of the Devicetree Specification

You can always find the latest released, as well as all older releases,
in our GitHub repository:

[Devicetree Specification releases](https://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification)

### How often is a new specification released
   
The target is once a year or when there is a significant change to prompt a
release.

## Governance

### Do I need to be a member to comment and send patches for the Spec?

No. Changes to the spec are proposed and discussed on a 
[public mailing list](http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#devicetree-spec)
and the source document is hosted in the
[Devicetree Specification](https://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification)
project on GitHub.

You can find details about the mailing list and submission process in the [Readme](README.md) file.

### What will membership give me?

Membership gives you a seat on Technical Steering Committee (TSC). 
The TSC is responsible for handling governance issues, 
managing the technical goals, release schedule, 
and helping to define vision for future versions of the spec.

### How is Linaro and devicetree.org connected?

Linaro kick started this process and is hosting devicetree.org under its organisation. 
[devicetree.org](http://devicetree.org) membership fees are associated with devicetree.org
only and not with Linaro membership.
The membership proceeds go towards the defraying of Linaroâ€™s costs for hosting devicetree.org.
